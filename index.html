        <h1 color="purple">Sematic elements</h1>
        <p>When bulding web pages, we use a combination of non semantic HTML and semantic HTML.The word semantic means
            <b> "relating to meaning"</b>,so smenatic elements provide information about the content between the opening
            and closing tags.</p>
        <p>&emsp; By using semantic HTML,we select HTML elements based on their meaning , not on hoe they are presented.
            Elements such as &lt;div&gt;and &lt;span&gt; are not semantic tag. Since they provide no context as to what
            is inside of those tags</p>
        <p>For example,instead of using a &lt;div&gt; element to contain our header information,we could use a
            &lt;header&gt;element,which is used as a heading section. By using &lt;header&gt; instead of a
            &lt;div&gt;,we provide context as to what informationisn inside of openingamd closing tags. </p>
        <h2>Why use Semantic Elements?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Accessbility:</b> Semantic HTML makes webpages accessiblr for mobile devices and people for
                disabilties as well. <br> This is because screen reader and browser the intrept the code better.</li>
            <li><b>SEO:</b>it improves the website SEO, OR SEARCH engine optimization, which is the process of
                increasing <br> the number of peoplethat visit your webpage</li>
            <li><b>Easy to understand:</b>Semantic HTML also make the website source code easier to read for other
                developer. </li>
        </ul>
        <p> &emsp;Many web sites contain HTML code like: &lt;div id="header"&gt;,&lt;div id="nav"&gt;,&lt;div
            id="main"&gt;,&lt;div id="footer"&gt;to indicate header,navigation,main content and footer.</p>
